# DOOM-nano-port-for-the-UNO-R4-
A basic port of the doom-nano project to be compatible with the uno R4 board. Some features may not work as intended but contains most of the things which were found in the original project. NOTE: Features that dont work as intended will be worked upon later and feedback is much appreciated!

pins for the buttons:

Fire | 10
Forward | 8
Back | 3
Right | 7
Left | 6

**OPTIONAL**

if you would like to add a passive buzzer then attach one wire to the negative rail and one wire to pin 9.
